# FE Framework Comparison 2024

This repo contains implementations of the same tiny to-do list app using three different front-end frameworks:
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/) via [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) via [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

A backend written in .NET Core serves the HTMX frontend and also acts as backend API for the other frontends.

The contents of the repo is meant to be helpful when evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the included frameworks, but does not claim to cover all aspects relevant to such a comparison.

## Instructions

- [Backend/HTMX](backend-htmx/README.md)
- [React](nextjs-react/README.md)
- [Svelte](svelte/README.md)
